Playing Pacman is easy to learn and hard to master (like all classic games). 
Simply use the arrow keys to control your pacman.
Score as many points as you can eating the small dots all around the maze. 
50 points per dot, A possible 9,350 points for each level, and if you gobble up 
a few fruits you add to the level.
The fruit i.e., the cherry, gives a small bonus of 100 points. 
Every Pacman attic has a love-hate relationship with the monsters.
However you want to stay far away as long as possible. 
Serious players will start to understand the personality of each of the monster and 
use this to their advantage. 
Once you've read this, take a few days to practice up on your newly honed skills. 
Then challenge your friends to a game of Pacman. You'll amaze them with your skill.
